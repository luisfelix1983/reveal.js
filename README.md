# Slides Luis Félix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js)

A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [markdown contents](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). It's best viewed in a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms but [fallbacks](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support) are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere.

## Online Editor

Presentations are written using HTML or markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at [http://slid.es](http://slid.es).


## Instructions

### Markup

Markup hierarchy needs to be ``<div class="reveal"> <div class="slides"> <section>`` where the ``<section>`` represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple ``<section>``'s inside of another ``<section>`` they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the "root" of the others (at the top), and it will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example:

```html
<div class="reveal">
	<div class="slides">
		<section>Single Horizontal Slide</section>
		<section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
		</section>
	</div>
</div>
```
